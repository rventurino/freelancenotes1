      <h1>Section 1: Should I freelance?</h1>

      <p>
        A.)Is freelancing a good fit for me? -self motivated? yes - do i need
        structure to succeed? no, I have not had a work schedule in my 3+ years
        with uber
      </p>
      <p>
        B.) What's the market like? $21.6 billion - roughly 24 million
        businesses in USA - roughly 30% of those don't have a site or an
        outdated site - If 30% of them need work done, that is 7 million
        businesses - 7 million * $3,000 = 21 billion dollar market
      </p>
      <h1>Section 2: How to Stand Out</h1>
      <p>
        A.) Disconnect between devs and people consuming services - Devs have
        trouble connecting with people - Understand that once you're a
        freelancer you are not a developer, you are a problem solver
      </p>
      <p>
        B.) Problem Solving - Coding skills mean nothing - Restaurant owner
        wants their pictures of their place up, not to know what stack you use -
        Address business needs
      </p>
      <p>
        C.) CLOSE! - being a problem solver lends itself to sales - a lot of
        people aren't comfortable selling - anyone can be good at this but it
        will take practice - you can sell your services, you need to do it - you
        must sell your services
      </p>
      <h1>Section 3: How to SELL</h1>
      <p>
        A.) Initial Meeting - Identify business problems - Ask about their
        clientele, online ordering, goals as a business, etc. - Identify how the
        business stands out - builds rapport with the business owner
      </p>
      <p>
        B.) Proposal - explain how you can address problems presented in step A
        - don't do this with too much jargon
      </p>
      <p>
        C.) CLOSE - the contract MUST include technical details - often this
        will happen quite fast and can be within the conversation
      </p>
      <p>
        Tips: Treat this with respect and seriousness, do not take calls when
        you're driving down the road. You need to take notes and be extremely
        attentive and detail oriented. You're dealing with someone else's
        business.
      </p>
      <h1>Section 4: WHERE to SELL</h1>

      <p>
        A.) Network - go to network events - most people will be other devs here
        - try to find places where there are will actually be small business
        owners, interested in talking about business
      </p>
      <p>B.) 3rd party: make less but high volume of customers</p>
      <p>c.) promote your own site on adwords. Avoid management services</p>
